# GIN DOI
GIN-DOI is the G-Node Infrastructure DOI service.
The service can, at the request of a repository owner, copy a public repository, pack everything into an archive file, store it in a safe location, and provide a DOI (digital object identifier) with which the archive can be cited.

Registered datasets can be found on the [Registered Datasets](https://doid.gin.g-node.org) on GIN.

For instructions on how to register a repository, see the [relevant help pages](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/DOIfile).

GIN-DOI fulfills the [DataCite](https://www.datacite.org/) standard which (according to Wikipedia) tries to:
* Establish easier access to research data on the Internet.
* Increase acceptance of research data as legitimate, citable contributions to the scholarly record.
* Support data archiving that will permit results to be verified and re-purposed for future study.
